# Self Care Dashboard
A very simple Android app to track 3-5 recurring goals related to personal health.

The Self Care Dashboard is based on the idea that no matter what state your life and health is in, there are 3-5 actions you can take or avoid at some regular interval to improve the situation. There many to-do/goal tracker apps and systems out there. GTD is awesome, and when I'm healthy I have terminals and phone apps and full integration of various approaches and tools. 

But particularly for sufferers of chronic physical or mental illness, there are times when the funk sets in and all that infrastructure falls apart. The Self Care Dashboard is designed to survive that fallout and help keep the very basics intact no matter how much trouble you're having with executive function.

For me personally, no matter what's going on I should:

* go for a long run at least every 4 days
* avoid sweets entirely for stretches of at least 7 days
* take my prescribed medication daily
* avoid alcohol for stretches of at least 5 days
* bathe at least every 2 days

### Using the Self Care Dashboard
When I go for a run, I long-click the 'go for a run' entry on dashboard. It turns green. Over its configured interval of 4 days, it turns red.

When I eat sweets, I activate that entry. Since the polarity of this goal is 'avoid', it turns red. Over the configured interval of 7 days, it smoothly fades to red.

At the top, I have an aggregate status somewhere between red and green. When the brain purgatory hits and I can't think in a straight line even if to save my job, I can glance at that score and choose the reddest item. "Say, I haven't degaussed my brain with a long run in a week!" Well, even if I accomplish nothing else today, I'll put all my reserves of gumption toward that, get a shower afterward (hey! that's two of em green!) and regroup. If I don't get my wits back today, I'll surely wake up in a better state tomorrow than I otherwise would have, and THEN I can do my GTD weekly review.

### How to get it

If you know how to compile and install Android APK's, take it for a spin! I'll update this page with instructions once it's beta-ready. Otherwise, wait awhile. I have plans to make an iOS version and do all the things you gotta do to properly release the app on both platforms. Most of my friends who expressed excitement about using the app are on iOS.
